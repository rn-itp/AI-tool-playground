# Negative 
- Docs are not as descriptive as they could. No API docs.
- It added the db usename and password in the readme.
- Build failed on first try because of db issues
- Multiple choice questions with only one possible option, and correct index is not bounded by number of options
- Sending quiz answers ends up in a 400
- No split between admin and quiz questions (would have preferred 2 controllers)

# Positive
- Code is readable and well structured
- Uses spring annotations in a pretty good manner
- Made a nice UI

# Overall 
Seems like Firebender but on top of VSCode and with a bit less java best practices knowledge

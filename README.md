Basic Quiz App

We need a simple online quiz application. Think something users can access through a website to test their knowledge. It doesn't need to be fancy, just functional and easy to use.

Core Functionality:

Questions: The system should be able to store and show all the questions we add.
Quizzes: Users should be able to take quizzes made up of these questions.
Results: At the end of a quiz, the system should show the user their score and which questions they got right or wrong.
Important Considerations:

We want to be able to easily add and manage questions and quizzes in the future.
It should be relatively easy to maintain and update.
It must use Java, Spring Boot, and Gradle because those are the technologies our team is familiar with.
We aren't concerned about user authentication for this initial version. Just want it to work.

Make sure to add documentation about how to run and test the system.

# Conclusions
If you want something very fast and do not care so much for all java best practices, go for Cursor. Otherwise, I would recommend Firebender. It is free, more dedicated towards the JVM so writes code more tailored towards java best practices and it reasons more if what it writes works (by both actual thinking and by testing it).

# Negative:
- Cursor is based on VSCode which is not very pretty for java code.
- No Frontend
- If trying to create a quiz with inexistent questions it gives a 500 error
- Only one controller/service that handle both questions and quizzes
- No swagger api docs or docstrings or tests
- hardcoded the number of answers for a question in 4 different variables

# Positive: 
- Very fast implementation
- Once code pass through (Positive because it makes it faster, but also negative because it can halucinates and then it requires manual prompting to fix)
- Good documentation - it gave example of requests for the APIs it described
- The flow it describes works
- Used Data annotation from lombok to minimize code

# Overall
Even though it is much faster, the AI seems to be sometimes lacking in Java best practices.
